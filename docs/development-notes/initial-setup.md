## Context

- Initial implementation of dual-interface Electron application
- Following project requirements from prd.md and .clinerules
- Focus on security and maintainability
- Minimal dependencies and build steps

## Changes Made

- Created basic project structure
- Implemented main process with Electron window management
- Set up web server with security headers
- Created renderer process with basic UI
- Implemented preload script for secure IPC
- Added shared logger service
- Set up initial test suite

## Impact Analysis

- Main process handles window creation and web server
- Renderer process manages UI and client-side logic
- Preload script enforces context isolation
- Tests cover basic functionality of both processes
- Security headers implemented for web interface

## Testing

- Unit tests for main process functionality
- Integration tests for web server
- DOM tests for renderer process
- Test coverage reporting available
- Continuous integration ready

## Future Considerations

- Add authentication system
- Implement HTTPS support
- Add end-to-end testing
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Add performance monitoring
