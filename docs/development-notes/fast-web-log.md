# Fast Web Server Optimization Log

## Initial Assessment

- Current web server using Express with basic configuration
- No HTTP/2 support
- No response compression
- Basic security headers
- No rate limiting
- Basic static file serving

## Task Information

- Implement performance optimizations from rules-for-webserver.md
- Add HTTP/2 support
- Implement compression
- Enhance security headers
- Add rate limiting
- Optimize static file caching
- Implement block-based architecture

## Change Documentation

```sh
Change Batch #1: Web Server Performance Optimizations
Timestamp: 2025-01-25 14:35
Location: src/main/web-server.js

Changes:
- Added HTTP/2 support using spdy
- Implemented compression middleware
- Enhanced security headers with helmet
- Added rate limiting
- Optimized static file caching

Preserved Elements:
- Existing CORS configuration
- Basic Express application structure
- Start/stop server functionality

Key Decisions:
- Used spdy for HTTP/2 support
- Chose compression level 6 for balance between speed and compression ratio
- Set cache headers for static files
- Implemented 15-minute rate limiting window
```

```sh
Change Batch #2: Block System Implementation
Timestamp: 2025-01-25 15:20
Location: src/renderer/blocks/

Changes:
- Implemented block registry system
- Added block loading functionality
- Created header, footer, hero, content, and steps blocks
- Implemented CSS loading for blocks
- Updated main.js with E-L-D loading pattern
- Added error handling for block loading

Preserved Elements:
- Existing DOM structure
- Current styling patterns
- Basic JavaScript functionality

Key Decisions:
- Used ES modules for block implementation
- Implemented CSS loading per block
- Added status tracking for blocks
- Maintained existing error handling patterns
```

```sh
Change Batch #3: Window Size Adjustment
Timestamp: 2025-01-25 15:45
Location: src/main/index.js

Changes:
- Increased default window dimensions by 50%
- Added DEFAULT_WIDTH and DEFAULT_HEIGHT constants
- Updated BrowserWindow creation to use new constants
- Width increased from 1200px to 1800px
- Height increased from 800px to 1200px

Preserved Elements:
- Existing window preferences and security settings
- Window event handling
- Development/production mode behavior
- Web server integration

Key Decisions:
- Used constants for window dimensions for maintainability
- Maintained aspect ratio while scaling
- Kept all window behavior and security settings intact
```

```sh
Change Batch #4: CSS Loading Path Fixes
Timestamp: 2025-01-25 16:00
Location: 
- src/renderer/blocks/header/header.js
- src/renderer/blocks/footer/footer.js
- src/renderer/scripts/lib.js
- src/renderer/scripts/main.js

Changes:
- Fixed CSS loading paths in header and footer blocks
- Removed leading slashes from CSS paths
- Updated loadCSS helper to handle relative paths
- Modified main.js to ensure base styles load first
- Changed to parallel block loading
- Removed requestIdleCallback for more reliable loading

Preserved Elements:
- Block functionality
- CSS content
- Loading sequence
- Error handling

Key Decisions:
- Made all paths relative to renderer directory
- Ensured base styles load before blocks
- Switched to Promise.all for parallel loading
- Maintained existing block structure
```

```sh
Change Batch #5: FOUC Prevention Implementation
Timestamp: 2025-01-25 16:30
Location: 
- src/renderer/styles/styles.css
- src/renderer/scripts/lib.js
- src/renderer/scripts/main.js
- docs/development-notes/rules-for-webserver.md

Changes:
- Replaced display:none with opacity transitions
- Added block loading state management
- Implemented status tracking for blocks
- Updated page initialization pattern
- Added smooth loading transitions
- Updated webserver rules documentation
- Removed requestIdleCallback for more reliable loading

Preserved Elements:
- Block functionality
- Loading sequence
- Error handling patterns
- Existing block structure
- Component architecture

Key Decisions:
- Used opacity instead of display for smoother transitions
- Added data-block-status attribute for state tracking
- Implemented Promise.all for parallel block loading
- Documented loading states in webserver rules
- Kept transitions short (0.2s) for performance
```

```sh
Change Batch #6: Force Push Phase2 Branch
Timestamp: 2024-03-21 
Location: Git Repository

Changes:
- Force pushed current Phase2 branch state to remote Phase2
- Updated fast-web-log.md to reflect the operation

Key Decisions:
- Used force push to ensure remote branch matches local state
- Updated documentation to maintain change history
```
