# Fast Web Server Optimization Log

## Initial Assessment

- Current web server using Express with basic configuration
- No HTTP/2 support
- No response compression
- Basic security headers
- No rate limiting
- Basic static file serving

## Task Information

- Implement performance optimizations from rules-for-webserver.md
- Add HTTP/2 support
- Implement compression
- Enhance security headers
- Add rate limiting
- Optimize static file caching
- Implement block-based architecture

## Change Documentation

```sh
Change Batch #1: Web Server Performance Optimizations
Timestamp: 2025-01-25 14:35
Location: src/main/web-server.js

Changes:
- Added HTTP/2 support using spdy
- Implemented compression middleware
- Enhanced security headers with helmet
- Added rate limiting
- Optimized static file caching

Preserved Elements:
- Existing CORS configuration
- Basic Express application structure
- Start/stop server functionality

Key Decisions:
- Used spdy for HTTP/2 support
- Chose compression level 6 for balance between speed and compression ratio
- Set cache headers for static files
- Implemented 15-minute rate limiting window
```

```sh
Change Batch #2: Block System Implementation
Timestamp: 2025-01-25 15:20
Location: src/renderer/blocks/

Changes:
- Implemented block registry system
- Added block loading functionality
- Created header, footer, hero, content, and steps blocks
- Implemented CSS loading for blocks
- Updated main.js with E-L-D loading pattern
- Added error handling for block loading

Preserved Elements:
- Existing DOM structure
- Current styling patterns
- Basic JavaScript functionality

Key Decisions:
- Used ES modules for block implementation
- Implemented CSS loading per block
- Added status tracking for blocks
- Maintained existing error handling patterns
```

## Implementation Record

```sh
Batch Status: Ready for Testing
Timestamp: 2025-01-25 15:20
Testing Notes:
- Verify HTTP/2 protocol support
- Check response compression
- Test rate limiting
- Validate security headers
- Verify static file caching
- Test block loading and rendering
- Verify CSS loading for blocks
- Check error handling for missing blocks
- Validate E-L-D loading pattern
