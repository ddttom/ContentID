# Fast Web Server Optimization Log

## Initial Assessment
- Current web server using Express with basic configuration
- No HTTP/2 support
- No response compression
- Basic security headers
- No rate limiting
- Basic static file serving

## Task Information
- Implement performance optimizations from rules-for-webserver.md
- Add HTTP/2 support
- Implement compression
- Enhance security headers
- Add rate limiting
- Optimize static file caching

## Change Documentation

```sh
Change Batch #1: Web Server Performance Optimizations
Timestamp: 2025-01-25 14:35
Location: src/main/web-server.js

Changes:
- Added HTTP/2 support using spdy
- Implemented compression middleware
- Enhanced security headers with helmet
- Added rate limiting
- Optimized static file caching

Preserved Elements:
- Existing CORS configuration
- Basic Express application structure
- Start/stop server functionality

Key Decisions:
- Used spdy for HTTP/2 support
- Chose compression level 6 for balance between speed and compression ratio
- Set cache headers for static files
- Implemented 15-minute rate limiting window
```

## Implementation Record

```sh
Batch Status: Ready for Testing
Timestamp: 2025-01-25 14:35
Testing Notes:
- Verify HTTP/2 protocol support
- Check response compression
- Test rate limiting
- Validate security headers
- Verify static file caching
