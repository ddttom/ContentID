# Initial Assessment

- Current codebase analysis completed
- Identified patterns and conventions match documentation
- Key architectural considerations verified

## Task Information

- Verify codebase matches docs/development-notes/lnitial-build.md
- Follow constraints from docs/development-notes/is-build-good.md
- Scope: Main process implementation verification
