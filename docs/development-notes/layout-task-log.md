# Initial Assessment

Timestamp: 2025-01-28 09:24

Current codebase analysis:

- index.html serves as the reference theme with modern, clean styling

Identified patterns and conventions:

- Use of CSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography
- Responsive grid layouts for content organization
- Consistent section padding and margins

Key architectural considerations:

- Maintain responsive design across all pages
