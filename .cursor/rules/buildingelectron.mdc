Note: The project intentionally avoids TypeScript to maintain simplicity and reduce build complexity. Instead, we focus on clear code organization through consistent module usage (ES modules for renderer process and services, CommonJS for main/preload scripts), comprehensive documentation, and thorough testing to ensure code quality. The project continues to maintain its focus on simplicity and performance while addressing core security and structural needs identified in the code review checklist. When ES module services need to be used by CommonJS code (like main process), thin adapter modules are used to bridge the gap while maintaining clean architecture.

Do not add tests unless the user requests them, Create test file in appropriate directory, tests/...., Import required modules and mocks

Development Requirements

   - Pure CSS without preprocessors
   - No build-heavy frameworks
   - Focus on simplicity and performance
   - ES modules for renderer process and services
   - CommonJS for main process and preload scripts
   - Clear code organization and documentation
   - Security through proper context isolation
   - Minimal dependencies and build steps
